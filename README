saferm -- Perl wrapper for rm command that helps to prevent accidental deletion of vital files

Copyright Nikolai Bezrounkov, 2019

Released uder Perl Artisitic License,  or MIT license. 

The key idea is to use a set of Perl regular expression to detect "creative uses of rm" -- situation when system files or important user files are accidentlaly deleted.

Default set of protection regex (perl regular expressions) is provided within the utility. It saferm is run as root it will be written to /etc/saferm.conf
on the first invocation, if no such file exists.

Default /etc/saferm.conf is written for RHEL 6/7 and /etc/saferm.conf needs to be manually adapted to other flavors of Linux

The unitlity performs additional "sanity" checks if -r (or -R) option is specified

Normally should be aliased to rm command, so that it is used only for interactive sessions.

== Installation ==

This utility depends on Perl and tree. Please note that in RHEL 7 minimal install the utility tree is not included and needs to be installed separatly via yum install tree


Currently installation consists of copying the script into one of the directories on your path an creation of the alias to this place. For example

alias rm='/usr/bin/saferm'


The program uses two blacklists (system-wide and user-specific), each of which consists of set of "typed"  Perl regular expressions.

Four types are currently supported:

    l- link
    f - file
    d - directory
    a - any type
    p - any type but matching performed as a prefix string not as regex.


Defaults are /etc/saferm.conf and ~/Saferm/saferm.conf . They can be overwritten via env. variables


   saferm_global_conf


and

   saferm_private_conf


correspondingly.


=== System configuration file ===


The first is so called system-wide blacklist which is located in /etc/saferm.conf.


If it does not exist on the first invocation it will be created from the default blacklist in the script.


After that you can edit it to adapt to your system (default system blacklist is Red Hat oriented)


=== User (or private) configuration file ===


The second is user blacklist lives in ~/Saferm/saferm.conf  and can add to system blacklist directories and files that are important for you.


It can be multiple such files tuned to different Tasks with different sets of protection regex. The one that is used can be symlinked to the ~/Saferm/saferm.conf
